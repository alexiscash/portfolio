This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

create-react-app is no longer supported and should not be used by developers to... create react apps.

The official React docs recommend using something like Next.js, Remix, or Gatsby. You can learn more about it [here](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)
